# Course-3-Assignment

From the LSE assignment page:
Turtle Games is a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Its product range includes books, board games, video games, and toys. The company collects data from sales as well as customer reviews. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends. 

You’ve been hired by Turtle Games to help analyse the available data and to share insights with stakeholders. To do so, you will:

Rely on Python and R code: You’ll analyse data and create a Jupyter Notebook and R script that includes key metrics to inform decision-making (such as demonstrating the customer clusters).
Prepare a report: You’ll write a report that explains your approach and any insights discovered.
Present your findings: You’ll communicate insights to stakeholders in a recorded presentation.
To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has come up with an initial set of questions. You’ll explore these questions in greater depth through the weekly assignment activities. Turtle Games wants to understand: 

how customers accumulate loyalty points
how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 
how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns
the impact that each product has on sales
how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales.
